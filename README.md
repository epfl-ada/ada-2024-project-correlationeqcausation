# What factors affect Oscar wins/nomiations?

## Abstract
The Oscar Academy Awards are some of the most renowned movie awards in the world. Experts and critics carefully select nominated movies, and reward a few of them with the awards. But are these awards aligned with the popular opinion? And, what are other factors that predict whether a movie wins or loses?  
To explore these questions, we will look at movie revenue and critical acclamation in relation to Oscar results. In addition to these factors, we will examine factors such as actor ethnicity, theme/genre of the movies, sentiment analysis of the reviews and actor history.  
We will explore this topic based on the CMU Movie Summary Corpus dataset, and [others](#additional-datasets). This study will be limited to American movies, as there is likely a skew towards American movies winning the Oscars.

## Research Questions
- Which is more important with regards to a movie being nominated for or winning an Oscar: critical acclamation, or box office performance?
- To what degree are Oscar winnings and nominations representative of the US population ethnicity statistics?

## Additional datasets
In addition to the CMU Movie Summary Corpus dataset, we will be using a dataset of Oscar awards (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/the-oscar-award) and
We join these with our main dataset without major problems, see [data preprocessing pipeline]
